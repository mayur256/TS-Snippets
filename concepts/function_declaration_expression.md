- **Function declaration** is a special statement in JS that creates a references to a *Function* object pointing to a section of code, that is independent, flexible, consistent and callable.
- Not to mention the fact that it makes a program impervious to *code duplication*.

- ```
  function name(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterN) {
   // body / logic
  }
  ```

- Here the function keyword precedes any valid JS identifier that can be used to invoke this function by appending the parenthesis operators.
