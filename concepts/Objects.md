# Objects
- Like every other language, Objects in Javascript are the most crucial entities and are the basic building blocks.
- Objects in JS are of the **reference types**, meaning whenever an object is **referenced** like passing it to a function as an argument, or assigning it to an identifier, it's done by accessing it's **address** in the memory.
- Objects are a **keyed** collection of heterogenous data.
- Objects in JS are more than just keyed collection, they are the backbones behind the meticulous mechanism that is responsible for driving states of the most sophisticated application that run on the browser or on server.
